# Apex-class
 Create an Apex class that implements the Database.Batchable interface to do the following in the org : 
 - query all Lead records with Country = 'US' 
 - for queried records, update LeadSource = 'Web' and Rating = 'Hot'.
 Write unit tests that achieve 100% code coverage for the class.
